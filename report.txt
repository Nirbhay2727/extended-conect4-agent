COL333 ASSIGNMENT 2

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Given a state of a board in modified connect four, determine the optimal move.


KEY IDEA:
We apply depth limited expectimax algorithm for implementing the random agent.
We apply depth limited minimax algorithm for implementing the AI agent with our self made evaluation function and alpha beta pruning.


EVALUATION FUNCTION:
Evaluation function is mainly the difference of get_score of each player for the given board configuration. This is incremented and decremented accoridng to the 
criteria of how much the agent's and opponent's square is towards the center respectively.
The values are further normalised.


ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION:
Expectimax
1. If the current call is a maximizer node, return the maximum of the state values of the nodes successors.
2. If the current call is a terminal node, then return the average of the state values of the nodes successors. 
3. We call the function recursively until we reach a terminal node(the state with no successors)or the cut-off value of depth. We then return the get_points for the state or the evaluation for the state respt.

Minimax
1. If the current call is a maximizer node, return the maximum of the state values of the nodes successors.
2. If the current call is a terminal node, then return the minimum of the state values of the nodes successors.
3. We call the function recursively until we reach a terminal node(the state with no successors)or the cut-off value of depth. We then return the get_points for the state or the evaluation for the state respt.


TESTING: 
AI agent wins everytime with a random agent. The score is 2-5 times more.
In AI vs AI the games are close with greater score within 1.5 times the lesser score.
